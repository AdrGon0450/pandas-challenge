Analysis

1. While I did not finish the dataframes I was able to conclude that schools with a larger capita per student had better scores than schools with a lower budget.
2. I also did notice that the reason the budgest was so high, was due to low number of students attending charter schools rather than large volume district schools.
3. Lastly, the number of students passing both math and reading did not deviate too much aside from a few outliers on both the low and high end of the range.
