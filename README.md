# pandas-challenge
Really frustrating one, Used a multitude of Stack overflow references for troubleshooting errors, but using groupby and similar functions are very lost on me. 
All code is written by me, no borrowed code.
Last half is all incorrect due to grouping and it not working.
Alot of multidimensional arrays due to the groupby pulling names instead of integers, and not able to list by school rather than by student.
